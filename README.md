## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get your project up and running locally.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd my-todo-vue
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Or using Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables (for AI Feature)

To enable the AI Motivation feature, you need a Google Gemini API key.

- **Obtain a Google Gemini API Key**: Go to [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/) (or Google Cloud Console) to generate your API key.

- **Create `.env` file**: In the **root directory** of your project (the same folder as `package.json`), create a file named `.env`.

- **Add API Key**: Add the following line to your `.env` file, replacing `YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY` with your key:

  ```
  VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY
  ```

  **Important**: Ensure no spaces around the `=` sign and no quotes around the API key.

### 4. Start the Development Server

Using npm:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or using Yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:5173/` (or another port if 5173 is in use).
